	<h3>What is UpBase?</h3>
	<p>UpBase is a database that organizes startups by what industry the are in and their business model category. It's meant to make it easier for entrepreneurs and investors to learn about the various businesses in a particular space. Anyone who feels they have knowledge of the startups in a particular industry can contribute their own database.</p>
	<h3>Why did you build UpBase?</h3>
	<p>I built UpBase after spending months research and talking to startups in the Outdoor industry. I found that existing databases like CrunchBase and Angelist don't categorize startups by grouping them with competitors who have similar buisness model. When researching a particular startup, it's always good to see who their competition is. I figured other investors and entreprneurs might benefit from my data and maybe be willing to contribute their own.</p>
	<h3>How can I contribute?</h3>
	<p>I spent 9 months researching the Outdoor Industry's startups and organized each company by their buisness model type. If you're working in a particular industry and feel you know who the different companies are in the space I'd love to chat. <a href="mailto:alex@kehaya.com">Conact me</a></p>
